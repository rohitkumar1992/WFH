                                    <p>What's the difference between subtitles and captions?</p>
                                    <p>Captions are meant for hearing-impaired individuals who can view video images but can't hear the soundtrack. Captions use words to communicate:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>The video's spoken content.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>Dubbing allows viewers to focus on the imagery in a film. Some films are highly visual, featuring beautiful scenery, breathtaking action, or emotional scenes.

When viewers who are slow readers must read subtitles during a movie, it can interrupt their enjoyment and understanding of the story.

However, dubbing is a costly and lengthy process. First, the entire script needs to be translated. But this isn't a simple, straight translation as with a document.
Each line of the film must generally fit the same time¬–space as the line in the original language. In other words, when an actor's mouth is moving, the spoken translation shouldn't be noticeably shorter or longer.
You probably recall watching some older or lower-quality films in which the dubbing didn't match the actor's mouth at all. Maybe the actor stopped talking while the line trailed on. Or the actor kept talking after the sound had stopped.
So, the translator must not only be skilled in translating idioms and jokes, but also in making the translation fit a certain time window. In some cases, this job is too big for the translator, and a dialogue writer must be brought in to make the translation work better.
Next, the script must be revoiced by actors who speak the target language. But it's not as if any actors will do. These actors must be carefully selected so that their voice matches the appearance of the actor in the film. You wouldn't want a 30-year-old man to read the part of a grandfather or a school-age child.
It's also critical that the voice actors don't overact their part. It's tempting for less skilled actors to get a little heavy-handed with line delivery, thinking it equates to doing a good job of being dramatic.
After all of this, the revoiced script must be mixed with the original soundtrack's atmospheric sounds and music.</p>

                                    <p>What's the difference between subtitles and captions?</p>
                                    <p>Captions are meant for hearing-impaired individuals who can view video images but can't hear the soundtrack. Captions use words to communicate:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>The video's spoken content.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>Dubbing allows viewers to focus on the imagery in a film. Some films are highly visual, featuring beautiful scenery, breathtaking action, or emotional scenes.

When viewers who are slow readers must read subtitles during a movie, it can interrupt their enjoyment and understanding of the story.

However, dubbing is a costly and lengthy process. First, the entire script needs to be translated. But this isn't a simple, straight translation as with a document.
Each line of the film must generally fit the same time¬–space as the line in the original language. In other words, when an actor's mouth is moving, the spoken translation shouldn't be noticeably shorter or longer.
You probably recall watching some older or lower-quality films in which the dubbing didn't match the actor's mouth at all. Maybe the actor stopped talking while the line trailed on. Or the actor kept talking after the sound had stopped.
So, the translator must not only be skilled in translating idioms and jokes, but also in making the translation fit a certain time window. In some cases, this job is too big for the translator, and a dialogue writer must be brought in to make the translation work better.
Next, the script must be revoiced by actors who speak the target language. But it's not as if any actors will do. These actors must be carefully selected so that their voice matches the appearance of the actor in the film. You wouldn't want a 30-year-old man to read the part of a grandfather or a school-age child.
It's also critical that the voice actors don't overact their part. It's tempting for less skilled actors to get a little heavy-handed with line delivery, thinking it equates to doing a good job of being dramatic.
After all of this, the revoiced script must be mixed with the original soundtrack's atmospheric sounds and music.</p>
